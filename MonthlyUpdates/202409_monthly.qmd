## Conditions

<!-- On `{r} sDate`, `{r} crewT`  -->
On 26 and 27 September 2024, Hans, Kris, Martin, and Paul went out to conduct our monthly oceanographic survey. We were able to take advantage of a narrow weather window and were able to sample all stations of the quarterly survey, including the extended Along-Bay transect. Winds were blowing from the west, turning towards the south on Friday. Sea conditions were at times rough with seas up to 3 feet on Thursday, but laid down on Friday. The preceeding week had seen its fair share of precipitation, even though total amounts were substantially lower than the long-term mean. A large low-pressure system was active in the Gulf of Alaska. 
<!-- Consider link to annual/sa-precip-AP.png -->

Because of battery problems with the older 5028 CTD, we used the newer 8138 instrument for the first time on a full survey. 


## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->


### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` $^\circ$C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` and depth of `{r} tsal$depth[1]` m to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` $^\circ$C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth). The AlongBay transect showed some interesting temperature patterns, also seen in salinity and density: Relatively fresh surface waters near the head of the bay were mixed down to about 20 m. This contrasts with the summer pattern, when the fastest change in density is usually found in the first 1-2 m near the surface, indicating that the summer stratification is in the process of breaking down.  

Peculiarly, the warmest water temperatures were at the end of the AlongBay transect in Cook Inlet (6_3), rather than at the head of the bay. Warm waters there extended down to about 20 m depth, where it was met by the coldest waters observed on this survey. The next station saw upwelling of this cold and saline deep water from 60 m at 6_3 to 25 m at 7_11. Presumably as a consequence of this (tidal-driven?) upwelling, surface waters were coldest off Pogi Point.   


### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth). Compared to last month, deep waters are slightly fresher, indicating that surface waters have been slowly mixed down, whereas minimal salinity is slightly higher, again indicating the coming end of summer stratification.

The two cross-bay transects show distinct slopes of density. This is indicative of currents moving along the bay. Especially in transect 4 we see a different slope, and therefore different current direction in the upper water column and in the deep channel. 

### Turbidity and Chlorophyll

Visually, waters were clear, a marked contrast to the previous months. In contrast to previous surveys, we see some clear spatial patterns in turbidity. This is probably due to the new instrument -- the older instrument is about to go back to the factory for servicing.
