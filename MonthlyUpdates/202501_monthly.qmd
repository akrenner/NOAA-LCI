## Conditions

<!-- On `{r} sDate`, `{r} crewT`  -->

On `{r} lastDateT`, Hans, Kris, and Martin went out to conduct our monthly oceanographic 
survey. Ever since December, it has been unseasonably warm. 
<!-- (@fig-Temp_Airport).  -->
Save the odd blizzard, 
there is little snow in town, but there is plenty of snow reported from up on the hills. 
South-central Alaska was hit by a major storm on Sunday, 12 January, bringing hurricane-force 
winds to the Anchorage area and flooding to the Anchor River. Maximal wind speeds 
measured at Homer Airport during this storm were 26 knots sustained, gusting to 40 knots.

## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->


### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth) to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth).
The unseasonably warm air temperatures left their mark on temperature and salinity patterns. Instead of a largely mixed water column with a the main gradient being between inner and outer bay, as seen in most years at this time, we found mostly horizontal stratification, with cold fresher water concentrated near the surface of the inner bay, 
diffusing towards warmer and more saline water at depth and in the outer bay (@fig-tSections_AB). Similarly, the T9 transect showed little horizontal, but strong vertical change (@fig-tSections_T9).


### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth). The spatial and vertical patterns of salinity were largely 
identical to those of temperature. Somewhat untypically for the season, spatial
pattern of density showed that while the waters at the far end of the outer bay were largely mixed, the water column should a diffuse stratification, spreading to deeper layers the farther one moved towards the head of the bay (see @fig-tSections_AB, bvf and  σ~θ~).


### Turbidity

Visually, the waters in the inner bay, while still relatively clear, were noticeably more turbid than in the outer bay. Measurements of turbidity showed that differences were slight, but surface waters in the inner bay were more turbid than the rest of the bay. 

## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Chlorophyll concentrations were low throughout Kachemak Bay. A small pocket of slightly
increased chlorophyll concentration could be found near the surface in the inner bay (@fig-tSections_AB, fluorescence). Phytoplankton samples were collected at the 
usual three stations (AB 3, 6, and 10) at 0 and 20 m depth. 

Oxygen levels can be indicative of biological activities. While overall high, highest concentrations were found near the surface in the inner bay, and lowest concentrations near the bottom in the inner bay. In this case, the simpler
explanation for the observed patterns may be vertical mixing of oxygen from the air 
in the outer bay and stratification inhibiting mixing in the inner bay. 

There were issues with the echosounder on Edgecombe, so we could not detect any
concentrations of deep-water backscatter.

## Current conditions compared to long-term trends

Temperature and salinity at T9-6 were close to the long-term mean (2012-present), both in shallow and in deep water layers (@fig-TSprofile_T9, @fig-TempDeep, @fig-SalDeep). Compared to the cold spells and heat-waves of the past, water temperatures at T9-6 have been remarkably close to the long-term mean for about four years. 
<!-- Reflecting the warm air -->
<!-- temperatures, we now see a small positive temperature anomaly (@fig-TempSurf).  -->
The SWMP station at Homer Harbor, recording oceanographic data continuously, has shown a 
positive temperature anomaly since early December (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp). Remarkably, the positive temperature anomaly at Homer Harbor is already at a magnitude only expected about once a decade. It remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a long-term
pattern or only a small blip. 

<!-- More figures: signature data = time series. Start with figures as-is, then elaborate on them (improving on anomaly plots). -->
