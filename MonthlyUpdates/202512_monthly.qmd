## Summary

After a month of unseasonal cold, dry weather with Northeasterly winds and ice in shallow waters, little sign of vertical stratification remained. Differences remained between a colder and fresher inner, and a warmer, saltier outer bay. Throughout the water column, temperatures were below the long-term mean, in parts by over 1.2 SD. All but deep waters in the inner bay were 0-1 SD fresher than normal. 

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

## Conditions

The month leading up to this survey was unusually cold (@fig-Temp_Airport) and dry, with winds generally blowing from the Northeast. Beluga Lake was frozen but there was virtually snow on the ground at sea-level. Mud Bay was filled with ice and Homer Harbor was impassable for small vessels due to the amount of ice. Hans, Martin, and Paul conducted the KBL monthly survey on 22 December. Due to the short available daylight, only the AlongBay transect was covered.  <!-- `{r} dateAN` , 
Sea state during this survey varied from Beaufort 1 to Beaufort 4.

<!-- While within normal limits, it has been a cool and wet June so far. Mean air temperature at Homer Airport were still below 10 °C [50  °F]. Conditions during the survey were choppy in the outer bay ( \< beaufort 5, with short steep waves up to 1.2 m, leading us to skip station AlongBay 1), but were predictably calmer in the inner bay. -->

## Physical oceanography

### Temperature

Recorded water temperatures during this survey ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth), in the inner bay off Bear Cove, to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth) in the outer bay, off Seldovia. There was little indication of vertical stratification, however horizontal difference were evident with warmer waters in the outer and coldest waters in the inner bay (@fig-tSections), A thin surface layer of slightly colder surface water was seen at the head of the bay, an area coinciding with impressive ice fog in the early morning. A local spot of colder water was found off Homer Spit (at about 30 km along-track, @fig-tSections). Presumably, colder (and fresher) water from Mud Bay, matching the characteristics of waters from the inner-bay, extended out to this area.

On a larger scale, satellite data showed a similar trend for sea surface temperatures, as observed here for Kachemak Bay, for Cook Inlet: warm waters from the Gulf of Alaska, gradually cooled, as they moved into the increasingly shallow waters of the upper inlet (@fig-SST_GOA).

<!-- Interesting temperature patterns were apparent along T9 and T4 (@fig-tSections). While the bottom half of the water column was still layered from cool bottom waters to warmer mid-waters, surface waters on T9 and the south end of T4 had cooled to be already colder than mid-water layers, the latter typically reaching their annual peak in September.  -->

<!-- ![Sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Alaska, based on satellite remote sensing](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/contour/alaska.fc.gif){#fig-SST_GOA} -->


Everywhere in the bay, and at all depths, water temperatures were below the long-term mean (top-right of @fig-tSections). While much of the North Pacific is still in a warm-water anomaly, the Gulf of Alaska had also moved into a negative temperature anomaly, in line with temperatures throughout Kachemak Bay ([global SST anomaly](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/products/ocean/sst/anomaly/)). 
The warm-water anomaly that was a feature in Kachemak Bay waters since the beginning of the year, appeared to have come to an end, at least for now (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp,
<!-- , @fig-TSprofile_T9,  -->
@fig-TempDeepTS). 


<!-- , water temperatures were again closer normal values. Most values along both, the AlongBay, and T9 transects were within 0.5 standard deviations of the long-term mean (anomaly plots on the right: @fig-tSections, @fig-tSections_T9). While surface layers along T9 remained over 0.5 SD above normal (@fig-tSections_T9, also see @fig-TempDeepTS), deep waters were within 0.5 SD of normal, both in the AlongBay transect and in T9 (@fig-tSections, @fig-tSections_T9, @fig-bottomTemp). -->


<!-- https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/products/ocean/sst/anomaly/ -->


<!-- Since the beginning of the year, water temperatures have been warmer than the seasonal mean, and this anomaly continued in August, but was diminished compared to previous months (@fig-TempDeepTS). The warm anomaly was also seen at the Homer SWMP station, operated by the KBNERR (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp), and most pronounced above the pycnocline (@fig-TSprofile_T9). The anomaly about 1 °C above the long-term mean, and remained near the 90th percentile.  -->

<!-- add sob plot on air temperature -->

### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) in the outer bay to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth) in the outer bay. The outer bay was a little bit more saline than the inner bay. Differences between deep and surface waters were minute, indicating an almost fully mixed water column (@fig-tSections). Compared to the long-term mean, surface, and especially outer bay waters, were by up to 1 SD saltier. 

Similarly to the heat wave years of 2014-16, the bay experienced anomalously warm waters for the first 2/3 of 2025. Since this fall, SST reverted to being saltier than normal (@fig-SalDeep)


![Variability of deep-water salinity at T9-6 compared to the seasonal long-term mean.](./media/5-SalDeepTS.png){#fig-SalDeep}

### Turbidity

The inner bay was more turbid than the outer bay (@fig-tSections). In contrast to last month, when deep waters were considerably more turbid than surface waters, there was no such contrast this month. 


## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Chlorophyll concentrations were close to zero throughout Kachemak Bay, showing no areas of concentrated activity (@fig-tSections).

<!-- ### Zooplankton -->

<!-- Echo sounder returns were weak to moderate at a few stations. No samples were taken.  -->
<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife

One late humpback whale was feeding off Bear Cove near the head of the bay.
