## Conditions

<!-- On `{r} sDate`, `{r} crewT`  -->

On 18 December 2024, Dom, Hans, and Paul went out to conduct our monthly oceanographic survey. It has been unseasonably mild and wet. Beluga Lake was still frozen, although with some water/slush on top of the ice. The beginning of December saw several high-wind events. Due to the reduced available daylight, AlongBay was sampled from station 2 to 11 (skipping 1).

## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->



### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` $^\circ$C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` and depth of `{r} tsal$depth[1]` m to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` $^\circ$C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth). Temperatures in the AlongBay showed a gradient from warmer outer to colder inner bay waters, with a front in the outer bay near the Homer Spit. While uniform temperature and salinity values in the outer bay indicated a largely mixed water column from surface to bottom, the inner bay was distinctly stratified. This stratification was not seen during the November survey. While superficially similar to the stratification pattern seen in summer, the pycnocline was located much deeper, at about 30 m depth (instead of less than 15 m). The T9 transect showed that the pycnocline was diffuser and shallower on the south, and sharper and deeper in the northern part of the bay, consistent with coastal freshwater influx from the Kachemak Bay watershed. 

### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth). As with temperature, stratification was seen in the inner, and a largely mixed water column in the outer bay. 

### Turbidity

Turbidity was found to be low throughout the bay, but particularly so in the outer bay. T9 showed a peculiar pattern of a donut-hole of particularly low-turbidity water at 50 m depth in the center of the transect, surrounded by slightly more turbid waters. 

## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Chlorophyll concentrations were low with little discernible spatial patterns. Corresponding oxygen concentrations also showed only a small range of variation, but did display some spatial patterns: highest values were found at the far end of the outerbay, in the entire water column. Lowest values were found in the deep hole of the AlongBay transect. T9 showed a gradient of oxygen concentration from high values in northern surface waters to intermediate values in southern surface waters and lowest values in bottom waters. Absolute values were about 50 \% lower compared to what was seen in the summer, but the spread of values was also much lower.

## Long-term trends at T9-6

Temperature and salinity at T9-6 remain close to the long-term mean (2012-present), both in shallow and in deep water layers (Figure 2).
