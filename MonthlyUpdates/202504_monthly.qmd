## Conditions

<!-- On `{r} sDate`, `{r} crewT`  -->

This is the first of these reports since January, so I'll cover the months February, March,
and April 2025. To keep it conscice, I will only include key graphics. A complete set up up-to-date graphs can be found on the google drive: 
section plots: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PCXyrK7tJ897bqqUPFcmGnjLAkGfi5So?usp=drive_link

<!-- CTD wall:      https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VN-g95QcZHpvIeMaH-HEvDzIX0f-cSe6?usp=drive_link -->

This April survey was split over two days: Hans, Kris, and Paul covered Transects 4 and 9 on the 2025-04-22. On `{r} lastDateT`, Hans, Paul, and Martin finished up with the AlongBay transect. 
<!-- (@fig-Temp_Airport).  -->
It has been a mild winter with only limited snow coverage in and around Homer (e.g. the Homer Epic, which ran on 8 March, had no skiing event due to poor snow conditions). The days around the April survey were spring-like with air temperatures between 0 and 5 °C and the occasional light rain shower.

## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->


### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures during the April survey ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth) to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth). The months of February and March were characterized by a typical winter regime for Kachemak Bay: a largely isotherm water columns in both the inner and outer bay, but with warmer waters in the outer bay, separated from the colder inner bay waters by a horizontal front near the Homer Spit. Remenants of this pattern were still apparent in April, however, the top-most water layers have began to warm up by a couple tenths of a degree (@fig-tSections_AB). T9 happen to be well placed in this front. While often rather homegenous, the T9 transect shows rather complex patterns this April: the warmer deep water from the outer bay is evident in the southern and deeper parts, a cold-water intrusion from the inner bay can be seen between 20 and 40 m depth in near the northern shore. A thin, but distinct, surface layer along most of T9 was up to 1 K warmer than the deeper inner-bay waters (@fig-tSections_T9).


### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth). Similarly to the temperature data, a freshening of the surface layer in the inner bay
is apparent, indicating the formation of the fresh-water-driven pycnocline, characteristic 
of the summer months. We can still observe remenants of a peculiar salinity pattern that 
appeared in February: fresher inner-bay waters being separated by only slightly saltier
outer bay waters by a sharp wedge of more saline bottom waters, reaching from the deepest parts of Kachemak Bay all the way to the surface around AlongBay 1. The same transition could still be observed in April, but the point of highest salinity had shifted to around Pogi Point. (see @fig-tSections_AB, bvf and  σ~θ~).










### Turbidity

Visually, the waters in the inner bay, while still relatively clear, were noticeably more turbid than in the outer bay. Measurements of turbidity showed that differences were slight, but surface waters in the inner bay were more turbid than the rest of the bay. 

## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Chlorophyll concentrations were low throughout Kachemak Bay. A small pocket of slightly
increased chlorophyll concentration could be found near the surface in the inner bay (@fig-tSections_AB, fluorescence). Phytoplankton samples were collected at the 
usual three stations (AB 3, 6, and 10) at 0 and 20 m depth. 

Oxygen levels can be indicative of biological activities. While overall high, highest concentrations were found near the surface in the inner bay, and lowest concentrations near the bottom in the inner bay. In this case, the simpler
explanation for the observed patterns may be vertical mixing of oxygen from the air 
in the outer bay and stratification inhibiting mixing in the inner bay. 

There were issues with the echosounder on Edgecombe, so we could not detect any
concentrations of deep-water backscatter.

## Current conditions compared to long-term trends

Temperature and salinity at T9-6 were close to the long-term mean (2012-present), both in shallow and in deep water layers (@fig-TSprofile_T9, @fig-TempDeep, @fig-SalDeep). Compared to the cold spells and heat-waves of the past, water temperatures at T9-6 have been remarkably close to the long-term mean for about four years. 
<!-- Reflecting the warm air -->
<!-- temperatures, we now see a small positive temperature anomaly (@fig-TempSurf).  -->
The SWMP station at Homer Harbor, recording oceanographic data continuously, has shown a 
positive temperature anomaly since early December (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp). Remarkably, the positive temperature anomaly at Homer Harbor is already at a magnitude only expected about once a decade. It remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a long-term
pattern or only a small blip. 

<!-- More figures: signature data = time series. Start with figures as-is, then elaborate on them (improving on anomaly plots). -->
