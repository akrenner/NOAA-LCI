## Summary

Air temperatures warmed from mid January to mid February 2026 to above the seasonal average. Inner Kachemak Bay waters remained colder (by up to one standard deviation, SD), and fresher (up to 1.5 SD) than normal throughout the water column. Conversely, outer bay/lower Cook Inlet waters were warmer and fresher than normal throughout the water column. Surface waters near the Homer Spit were unusually turbid, perhaps released from melting ice out of Mud Bay. 
A localized plume in the surface waters off the Homer Spit was unusually turbid for this location.

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

## Conditions

After an unusually cold start of the year, air temperatures in February were above the seasonal average. A thin cover of snow/ice covered much of Homer. Snow-water equivalent at the McNeil Canyon SNOTEL site was low (10th percentile).  The intertidal of Mud Bay was covered in ice, but Homer Harbor was largely ice-free. Near the head of the bay, small floes of sea-ice, were seen, also less than in January. Hans, Kris, and Martin conducted the KBL monthly survey on 12 (extended AlongBay transect), and 17 February (across-bay transects T9 and T4). Sea state conditions on 12 February were moderate in lower Cook Inlet and glassy calm in the inner bay, and light to moderate on 17 February.
<!-- Beaufort 1 to 2. -->


![Recent air temperatures at the Homer Airport, compared to the seasonal mean.](./media/sa-airTemp-LE.png){#fig-Temp_Airport}

<!-- While within normal limits, it has been a cool and wet June so far. Mean air temperature at Homer Airport were still below 10 °C [50  °F]. Conditions during the survey were choppy in the outer bay ( \< beaufort 5, with short steep waves up to 1.2 m, leading us to skip station AlongBay 1), but were predictably calmer in the inner bay. -->

## Physical oceanography

### Temperature

Water temperatures during this survey ranged from a minimum of station `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth), in the mid bay, to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth) in lower Cook Inlet. Cook Inlet and outer bay waters were vertically mixed. A pronounced horizontal gradient from warmer, saltier Cook linlet waters to colder, fresher inner bay waters, was found near the Homer Spit. Inner bay waters showed stratification with a thin cold surface layer over warmer deep waters (@fig-tSections_AB, top-left panel). 

<!-- T9 is situated around km 30 of the AlongBay transect, cross-sectioning the inner/outer bay transition zone. Sloping salinity and temperature contour lines showed influx of warmer, more saline water at depth, especially on the south side, and an outflow of colder, fresher water on the surface at the north side of T9 (@fig-tSections_T9). While the entire water column was colder than normal, the strong surface water cold anomalies found near the Spit were likely caused by melting pack ice from Mud Bay (also note the dip in salinity at the same location).  -->

:::


Sea surface temperature data displayed similar patterns to last month, showing a gradient of warm water from the Gulf of Alaska, to the increasing cooler and shallower coastal waters of Cook Inlet (@fig-SST_GOA). 


<!-- Interesting temperature patterns were apparent along T9 and T4 (@fig-tSections). While the bottom half of the water column was still layered from cool bottom waters to warmer mid-waters, surface waters on T9 and the south end of T4 had cooled to be already colder than mid-water layers, the latter typically reaching their annual peak in September.  -->

Inner and much of outer Kachemak Bay water temperatures remained colder than normal (@fig-tSections, @fig-bottomTemp, @fig-TempDeepTS). Lower Cook Inlet waters, however, were over one standard deviation (in this case 0.4 °C) warmer than the seasonal mean, from the surface down to depth (@fig-tSections_AB). Surface waters of the Gulf of Alaska, as shown by satellite data, had warmed from colder than normal condition in January, again matching the warm-water anomaly of most of the North Pacific, (@fig-SSTA). 

For surface waters, satellite data showed that the rest of the Gulf of Alaska was also no longer colder than normal (@fig-SSTA).

<!-- Since the beginning of the year, water temperatures have been warmer than the seasonal mean, and this anomaly continued in August, but was diminished compared to previous months (@fig-TempDeepTS). The warm anomaly was also seen at the Homer SWMP station, operated by the KBNERR (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp), and most pronounced above the pycnocline (@fig-TSprofile_T9). The anomaly about 1 °C above the long-term mean, and remained near the 90th percentile.  -->

### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at station `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) near Homer Spit to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at station `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth) in lower Cook Inlet.
Inner bay waters were fresher than outer bay waters. The outer bay, and especially lower Cook Inlet, was more saline than the inner bay (@fig-tSections). Weak vertical stratification was evident in the inner bay. The water column in lower Cook Inlet, off Port Graham and Point Pogibshi was vertically mixed, as indicated by vertical contours in salinity and temperature (@fig-tSections_AB). Along the inner bay, across mid-bay (T9) and into the eastern parts of the outer bay, a thin layer (~10-20 m) of cold, fresh water was seen over warmer, more salty water at depth, indicating that there had been enough freshwater input to maintain vertical stratification despite cold temperatures (@fig-tSections). 

Compared to the long-term means, much of the inner bay, including all of T9, was fresher than normal, in some areas by over 2 standard deviations (SD). Some deep waters of lower Cook Inlet, on the other hand, were over 1.5 SDs saltier than normal. Salinity at mid-bay stations was close to normal, after major anomaly fluctuations in 2025 (@fig-SalDeep). 


![Variability of deep-water salinity at T9-6 compared to the seasonal long-term mean.](./media/5-SalDeepTS.png){#fig-SalDeep}

### Turbidity

Inner bay waters were slightly more turbid than outer bay waters. Visually, we noticed high surface turbidity, off the Homer Spit. This was also noted by the turbidity sensor, recording unusually high turbidity of 2.5 SD more than normal along T9 off Homer Spit (@fig-tSections_T9), which was also the highest turbidity measured anywhere during this survey. This pattern was consistent with the source of the turbidity coming from sediments carried in melting ice originating in Mud Bay. 

## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Chlorophyll concentrations were low throughout Kachemak Bay, as expected for February, and were near or below the long-term mean (@fig-tSections, @fig-chlorophyll). There were pockets of elevated chlorophyll concentrations near the surface, however (@fig-tSections_AB), corresponding with elevated O~2 saturation at about 15 m, indicating an onset of primary production (@fig-tSections).

<!-- ![Time section of Chlorophyll concentrations at T9-6.](./media/3-9_6-chlorophyll-timesection.png){#fig-chlorophyllsection}  -->


<!-- ### Zooplankton -->

<!-- Echo sounder returns were weak to moderate at a few stations. No samples were taken.  -->
<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife

Two harbor seals were seen off Bear Cove. About 65 Steller sea lions were seen on Flat Island. Birds of note included a yellow-billed loon off Bear Cove. Common murres and marbled murrelets started to return to the inner bay.
