## Summary

Summer conditions of a stratified water column. Nutrient limitation is evident in the inner bay. 

Upwelling in Cook Inlet -> cold waters

Surface waters in the inner bay are noticeably freshening and warming up, compared to what was seen in April (maximum: `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C). At all depths, waters continue to be warmer and less saline than the seasonal mean, matching the criteria of a moderate marine heat wave. Chlorophyll concentrations quintupled since April and are now amongst the highest in the last four years.

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

## Conditions

On `{r} dateAN`, Chris, Hans, Martin, and Ross conducted our monthly survey. While within normal limits, it has been a cool and wet June so far. Average air temperature at Homer Airport is still below 10 °C [50  °F]. Conditions during the survey were choppy in the outer bay ( \< beaufort 5, with short steep waves up to 1.2 m, leading us to skip station AlongBay 1), but were predictably calmer in the inner bay. <!-- `{r} crewT` --> A complete set of up-to-date graphs can be found on the Google Drive: [section plots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PCXyrK7tJ897bqqUPFcmGnjLAkGfi5So?usp=drive_link) and [time sections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bkBPSBfvKjcgkOtikhIfLPOMwjgziJ8t?usp=drive_link).

## Physical oceanography

### Temperature

Recorded water temperatures during this survey ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth) in the inner bay to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth). Throughout the bay, even in the outer bay, thermal stratification was evident, with a thin layer of surface water covering colder mid- and deep waters. In contrast to winter, differences between the inner and outer bay were minor: surface layers were warmer in the inner bay, whereas mid- and deep waters were warmer in the outer bay (@fig-tSections_AB). Only minor temperature differences were apparent between the north and south end of the mid-bay Transect 9 (@fig-tSections_T9), showing a gradual warming from deep to shallow waters, with fastest changes near the surface.

Longitudinal and cross-sections of main parameters.

Satellite observations showed that farther out in Cook Inlet, surface waters were substantially cooler (3 K) than in the bay, and even cooler than in much of coastal Gulf of Alaska (@fig-SST_GOA).

Since the beginning of the year, water temperatures in the middle of the bay, at station T9-6, have been warmer than the seasonal mean. This anomaly continuous in a much demished form in the deep waters (@fig-TempDeep). In line with the cool air temperatures, this anomaly is no longer evident at the surface (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp, @fig-TSprofile_T9). <!-- add sob plot on air temperature -->

### Salinity

Salinity values in May ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth), near Bear Cove and Seldovia, respectively. A substantial layer of fresher water, from the surface down to about 25 m depth was present in all but the outermost parts of the bay @fig-tSections_AB, @fig-tSections_T9).


Very head of the bay: local upwelling (wind driven?) -- despite the nearby fox river. 



From the inner bay to the eastern half of the outer bay, a distinct lens of fresher (and now warmer) water was apparent (@fig-tSections_AB), reflecting increased freshwater runoff from precipitation and snow melt. This freshened surface layer was about twice as thick on the northern end of Transect 9, compared to the southern end (@fig-tSections_T9), which is consistent with freshwater originating from around the inner Kachemak Bay watershed, including Fox and smaller rivers.

The warm temperature anomaly was accompanied by a low salinity anomaly in Kachemak Bay waters (@fig-SalDeep). Just as for temperature, the salinity anomaly was found throughout the water column, although it was slightly more pronounced at depth (@fig-TSprofile_T9).

![Variability of deep-water salinity at T9-6 compared to the seasonal long-term mean.](./media/5-SalDeepTS.png){#fig-SalDeep}

### Turbidity

We did not encounter any high-turbidity surface water, indicative of glacial run-off. As expected, inner bay waters were more turbid than outer bay waters. Increased turbidity near the surface in the inner bay may be due to a combination of sediments from terrestrial run-off and high concentrations of phytoplankton (@fig-tSections).

## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Phytoplankton were blooming! High concentrations of chlorophyll were observed with the CTD fluorometer between the surface and 30 m throughout the bay, with particularly high concentrations in the inner bay at around 25 m depth (@fig-tSections_AB). Concentrations at T9-6 were amongst highest at this station in the last four years.

![Trends and seasonal anomaly of Chlorophyll concentrations at T9-6 (average from surface to 85 m depth)](./media/3-9_6-fluorescence-anomaly.png){#fig-chlorophyll} In our surface samples, Kim Schuster and Jasmine Maurer (KBNERR) found bloom-levels of *Chaetoceros debilis* and *Pseudo-nitzschia* spp. in the inner bay at AlongBay-06 and AlongBay-10, respectively.

### Zooplankton

A weak deep scattering layer, mostly below 40 m was observed at many stations. We sampled this layer with an oblique at T9-6 (towed from 75 m to the surface). Lisa Spittler, from USFWS Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, kindly looked at the samples and identified species. The vast majority of individuals were calanoid copepods of different species and sizes. There were also three large euphausiids, several chaetognaths, barnacle nauplii, and zoea larvae (@fig-zoop).

<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife

No marine mammals or birds beyond the common expected species were noted.
