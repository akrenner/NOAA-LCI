## Conditions

<!-- On `{r} sDate`, `{r} crewT`  -->

On 10 October 2024, Mike, Martin, and Paul went out to conduct our monthly oceanographic survey. We had a one-day window of calm, and even sunny weather, before a major storm hit the following day, sampling all of the AlongBay and T9 transects. Winds were between 5 knots from the SW to flat calm. Like last month, we used the 8138 CTD.

## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->

### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` $^\circ$C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` and depth of `{r} tsal$depth[1]` m to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` $^\circ$C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth). Despite only two weeks between this and the preceeding survey, distinct changes in temperature patterns could be observed. Most notably, falling air temperatures have now cooled the mixed surface layer. This was the warmest part of the water column last month, but is now the coldest in all but the outermost AlongBay stations, flipping the direction of the thermocline at the bottom of the mixed surface layer. Spatially, we were still seeing a warmer inner and a colder outer bay. 

Temperature patterns on T9 were remarkably complex, with up to three warm-water layers sandwiched between colder waters, where warmer inner bay water in the north meets colder outer bay water in the south. This inner bay water was also noticeably more turbid than outer bay water, both at the surface and at depth. The AlongBay transect graphically illustrated the contrast between warm inner-bay and cold outer-bay waters. T9 happened to coincide with the transition between these two water bodies, and since the overall temperature gradient was small, complex mixing patterns, likely enhanced by turbulance behind the Homer Spit, ensued.           


### Salinity

Salinity values ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth). Compared to last month, deep waters were slightly fresher, which should be due to the seasonal freshening of the source water in the Alaska Coastal Current. A distinct halocline is found throughout the surveyed area, probably now at its maximal extend, even covering the outer bay. 


### Turbidity

Especially the waters in the outer bay were remarkably clear, with secchi depth readings in excess of 10 m. Turbid waters were encountered off Glacier Spit in the inner bay, but also in the northern half of T9. Patterns of turbidity at T9 closely matched the distribution of warm waters, but less so of salinity, for which I don't have a ready explanation. 

Oxygen levels were depleted at depth, especially in the inner bay, but comparatively high in the outer bay. 


## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Chlorophyll concentrations were generally low in the outer bay, with only slightly higher values found near the pycnocline than at depth. The inner bay still showed raised chlorophyll concentrations at the pycnocline. Yet, at T9_6, chlorophyll concentrations were still high compared to the long-term mean. 

The sonar showed backscatter near the bottom on several AlongBay stations near the spit. We took a water sample at AlongBay_12 in 65 m depth (10 m above the bottom) using the Niskin bottle and filtered the water through the plankton net. Lisa Spittler helped identify a small number of copepods (mostly larval stages with 2-3 tail segments), about 1 mm in size, and an ostracode in this sample.

<!-- ### Zooplankton -->

<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife

A pod of 5-7 female killer whales was encountered at T9_8, off Land's End. Acoustic backscatter of individual fish (possibly salmon) was also noticed at this station.

A seasonally late Red-necked Phalarope was foraging on a convergence at AlongBay_4.
