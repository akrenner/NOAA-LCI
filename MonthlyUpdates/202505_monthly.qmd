## Summary
Compared to last April, surface waters in the inner bay are freshening and 
warming up (maximum: `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C). Chlorophyll concentrations
quintupled since April and are now high throughout the bay. Compared to the 
seasonal mean, waters at all depths continue to be warm and less saline  (since 
February 2025), even though temperatures in Homer harbor have returned to close 
to normal values. 
<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

## Conditions

On `{r} dateAN`, Hans, Kris, and Martin conducted our monthly survey. It has been a fairly dry and sunny May so far, with only a minor precipitation. Conditions during the survey were calm, with beauford conditions between 1 and 2.

## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->

### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures during this survey ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth) in the inner bay to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth) off the Spit. Surface waters in the inner bay were over three K warmer
than deep waters, wereas only little differences in temperature or salinity were found at the western end of the 
AlongBay transect, indicating a water column that is still vertically mixed (@fig-tSections_AB). 
Only minor temperature differences were apparent between the north and south end of 
Transect 9  (@fig-tSections_T9), showing a gradual warming from deep to shallow waters, 
with fastest changes near the surface. In contrast to last month (and much of the winter),
the waters in the far end of the outer bay, influenced by the Gulf of Alaska, were
no longer noticably warmer than the main water body of Kachemak Bay. 


### Salinity

Salinity values in May ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth), near Gull Island and Seldovia, respectively. 
All the way into the the eastern half of the outer bay, a distinct lens of fresher (and now warmer)
water is apparent (@fig-tSections_AB), Consistent with much of this freshwater originating
from the Kachemak Bay watershed, this layer of fresher surface water was about twice 
as thick on the northern end of Transect 9, compared to the southern end (@fig-tSections_T9).

### Turbidity

We did not encounter any high-turbidity surface water, indicative of glacial run-off during the April survey. Overall, inner bay bottom waters were more turbid than outer bay waters, as usual. Turbidity levels in the outer bay were the lowest we have observed all year. These were relatively warm, saline waters, consistent with an intrusion of Gulf of Alaska shelf water.

## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

While still low in the outer bay, compared to February and March, chlorophyll concentrations were elevated in the upper water layers of the inner bay (just below the pycnocline, as indicated by the corresponding bvf values) -- a sign of spring. Oxygen levels were correspondingly raised in these areas as well (@fig-tSections_AB).


![Seasonal anomaly of Chlorophyll concentrations](./media/3-9_6-fluorescence-anomaly.png){#fig-chlorophyll}


### Zooplankton

A diffuse weak deep scattering layer, mostly between 50 m and the bottom was detected at many stations. We sampled this layer with an oblique at T9-6 (towed at 70 m). Lisa Spittler, from USFWS Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, kindly looked at the samples and identified species. The vast majority of individuals were calanoid copepods of different species and sizes. There were also three large euphausiids, several chaetognaths, barnacle nauplii, and zoea larvae.

<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife

Marine mammals of note included a Harbor Porpoise in the inner bay near Homer Spit and a Harbor Seal in the inner Bay. A Yellow-billed Loon was in the outer bay, and a dark morph Parasitic Jaeger in the inner bay. Small groups of Red-necked Phalaropes were present near convergences throughout the bay.

## Present conditions compared to long-term trends

After three years of water temperatures closely hugging the long-term mean, deeper water temperatures were warmer than the seasonal mean starting in February. Current temperatures were up to 1 K above the long-term seasonal mean (@fig-TempDeep). This positive temperature anomaly has been accompanied by a low salinity anomaly (@fig-SalDeep), which is consistent with high amounts of rain in the region. Both, the temperature, and salinity anomalies are found throughout the water column, although they are slightly more pronounced at depth (@fig-TSprofile_T9).

<!-- Reflecting the warm air -->

<!-- temperatures, we now see a small positive temperature anomaly (@fig-TempSurf).  -->

The SWMP station at Homer Harbor, recording oceanographic data continuously, has shown a positive temperature anomaly since early December 2024, which intensified to a level that from January to until late March 2025, values were above the 90th percentile. However, since early April, the SWMP data has seen a slow return towards the long-term mean (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp).

<!-- More figures: signature data = time series. Start with figures as-is, then elaborate on them (improving on anomaly plots). -->
