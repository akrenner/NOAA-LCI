## Summary
<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

## Conditions

On `{r} sDate`, Hans, Kris, and Martin conducted our monthly survey. It has been
a fairly dry and sunny May so far, with only a minor precipitation. Conditions on during
the survey were calm, with beauford conditions between 1 and 2.

## Physical oceanography

<!-- Current conditions, long-term anomalies: -->


### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures during the May survey ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth) in the outer bay
to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth) off the Spit. 
The months of February and March were characterized by a typical winter regime for Kachemak Bay: colder surface than deep waters, but overall small differences in water temperature at at individual stations, the main differences being a warmer outer bay, separated from the colder inner bay waters by a front near the Homer Spit. Remnants of this pattern were still apparent in April, however, as a consequence of rain and break-up conditions, the top-most water layers have begun to warm up by a couple tenths of a degree (@fig-tSections_AB). T9 transect showed rather complex patterns this April: the warmer deep water from the outer bay on the southern side, cold inner-bay water near the northern shore, all of which overlayed by a thin, up to 1 K warmer surface layer (@fig-tSections_T9).


### Salinity

Salinity values in April ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth), 
at the north and south end of the outer bay, respectively. This is consistent with saltier (and warmer) deep water from the Gulf of Alaska flowing into the bay near the southern shore and fresher water, fed by rain, river, and meltwaters, exiting along the northern shore (@fig-tSections_T4). Similarly to the temperature data, a freshening of the surface layer in the inner bay
is apparent, indicating the formation of the fresh-water-driven pycnocline, characteristic 
of the summer months. 


### Turbidity

We did not encounter any high-turbidity surface water, indicative of glacial run-off during the April survey. Overall, inner bay bottom waters were more turbid than outer bay waters, as usual. Turbidity levels in the outer bay were the lowest we have observed all year. These were relatively warm, saline waters, consistent with an intrusion of Gulf of Alaska shelf water. 


## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

While still low in the outer bay, compared to February and March, chlorophyll concentrations were levated in the upper water layers of the inner bay (just below the pycnocline, as indicated by the corresponding bvf values)  -- a sign of spring. Oxygen levels were correspondingly raised in these areas as well (@fig-tSections_AB).

### Zooplankton

A diffuse weak deep scattering layer, mostly between 50 m and the bottom was detected at many stations. We sampled this layer with an oblique at T9-6 (towed at 70 m). Lisa Spittler, from USFWS Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, kindly looked at the samples and identified species. The vast majority of individuals were calanoid copepods of different species and sizes. There were also three large euphausiids, several chaetognaths, barnacle nauplii, and zoea larvae. 

<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife
Marine mammals of note included a Harbor Porpoise in the inner bay near Homer Spit and a Harbor Seal in the inner Bay. A Yellow-billed Loon was in the outer bay, and a dark morph Parasitic Jaeger in the inner bay. Small groups of Red-necked Phalaropes were present near convergences throughout the bay. 


## Present conditions compared to long-term trends

After three years of water temperatures closely hugging the long-term mean, deeper water temperatures were warmer than the seasonal mean starting in February. Current temperatures were up to 1 K above the long-term seasonal mean (@fig-TempDeep). This positive temperature anomaly has been accompanied by a low salinity anomaly (@fig-SalDeep), which is consistent with high amounts of rain in the region. Both, the temperature, and salinity anomalies are found throughout the water column, although they are slightly more pronounced at depth (@fig-TSprofile_T9). 

<!-- Reflecting the warm air -->
<!-- temperatures, we now see a small positive temperature anomaly (@fig-TempSurf).  -->
The SWMP station at Homer Harbor, recording oceanographic data continuously, has shown a 
positive temperature anomaly since early December 2024, which intensified to a level that
from January to until late March 2025, values were above the 90th percentile. However, since early April, the SWMP data
has seen a slow return towards the long-term mean (@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp). 

<!-- More figures: signature data = time series. Start with figures as-is, then elaborate on them (improving on anomaly plots). -->
