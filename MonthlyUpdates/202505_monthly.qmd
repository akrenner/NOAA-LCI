## Summary
Compared to last April, surface waters in the inner bay are freshening and 
warming up (maximum: `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C). At all depth, waters continue to be warmer and less saline (since February 2025) than the seasonal mean, matching the criteria of a moderate marine heat wave. Chlorophyll concentrations
quintupled since April and are now at their highest in the last four years.

## Conditions

On `{r} dateAN`, Hans, Kris, and Martin conducted our monthly survey. It has been a fairly dry and sunny May so far, with only a minor precipitation. Conditions during the survey were calm, with beauford conditions between 1 and 2.

### Temperature

<!-- add info on long-term normals for max and min recorded values? mean +/- SD?  -->

Recorded water temperatures during this survey ranged from a minimum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[1]` °C at station `{r} tsal$stn[1]` (`{r} tsal$depth[1]` m depth) in the inner bay to a maximum of `{r} tsal$temSalR[2]` °C at `{r} tsal$stn[2]` (`{r} tsal$depth[2]` m depth) off the Spit. Surface waters in the inner bay were over three K warmer
than deep waters, wereas only little differences in temperature or salinity were found at the western end of the 
AlongBay transect, indicating a water column that is still vertically mixed (@fig-tSections_AB). 
Only minor temperature differences were apparent between the north and south end of 
Transect 9  (@fig-tSections_T9), showing a gradual warming from deep to shallow waters, 
with fastest changes near the surface. In contrast to last month (and much of the winter),
the waters in the far end of the outer bay, influenced by the Gulf of Alaska, were
no longer noticably warmer than the main water body of Kachemak Bay. Interestingly,
satellite based measurements show that coastal waters of the Gulf of Alaska are 
already similarly warm as Kachemak Bay, whereas much of Cook Inlet and the adjacent
continental shelf remain about 1 K cooler (@fig-SST_GOA).

After three years of water temperatures closely hugging the long-term mean, deep 
water temperatures were warmer than the seasonal mean starting in February. Current 
temperatures were about 0.5 K above the long-term seasonal mean (@fig-TempDeep). 
At the SWMP station in Homer Harbor, temperatures rose well
above the seasonal mean already earlier, starting in December 2024 
(@fig-SWMP-homerdeep-temp). Temperatures at the SWMP station were nearing the 
long-term mean again, however, in the bay, the whole water column was still 
experiencing conditions matching the criteria for a moderate marine heat wave
 (@fig-TSprofile_T9).

### Salinity

Salinity values in May ranged from `{r} tsal$temSalR[3]` PSU at `{r} tsal$stn[3]` (`{r} tsal$depth[3]`m depth) to `{r} tsal$temSalR[4]` at `{r} tsal$stn[4]` (`{r} tsal$depth[4]`m depth), near Gull Island and Seldovia, respectively.
All the way into the the eastern half of the outer bay, a distinct lens of fresher (and now warmer)
water is apparent (@fig-tSections_AB). This layer of fresher surface water was about twice as thick on the northern end of Transect 9, compared to the southern end (@fig-tSections_T9), which is consistent with freshwater
originating from the Kachemak Bay watershed. 

The current positive temperature anomaly were accompanied by a low salinity 
anomaly (@fig-SalDeep). Just as for temperature, the salinity anomaly was found throughout the water column, although it were slightly more pronounced at depth (@fig-TSprofile_T9).

![Variability of deep-water salinity at T9-6 compared to the seasonal long-term mean.](./media/5-SalDeepTS.png){#fig-SalDeep}


### Turbidity

We did not encounter any high-turbidity surface water, indicative of glacial run-off. 
As expected, inner bay waters were more turbid than outer bay waters. Increased
turbidity near the surface in the inner bay may be due to a combination of glacial
run-off and high concentrations of phytoplankton (@fig-tSections_AB).


## Biological conditions

### Phytoplankton

Phytoplankton was blooming. High concentrations of chlorophyll were encountered 
between the surface and 30 m throughout the bay, with particularly high concentrations
in the inner bay at around 25 m depth (@fig-tSections_AB). Concentrations at T9-6
were the highest at this station in the last four years.  

![Trends and seasonal anomaly of Chlorophyll concentrations at T9-6 (average from surface to 85 m depth)](./media/3-9_6-fluorescence-anomaly.png){#fig-chlorophyll}


### Zooplankton

A diffuse weak deep scattering layer, mostly between 50 m and the bottom was detected at many stations. We sampled this layer with an oblique at T9-6 (towed at 70 m). Lisa Spittler, from USFWS Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, kindly looked at the samples and identified species. The vast majority of individuals were calanoid copepods of different species and sizes. There were also three large euphausiids, several chaetognaths, barnacle nauplii, and zoea larvae.

<!-- Backscatter? Species composition? -->

### Wildlife

Marine mammals of note included a Harbor Porpoise in the inner bay near Homer Spit and a Harbor Seal in the inner Bay. A Yellow-billed Loon was in the outer bay, and a dark morph Parasitic Jaeger in the inner bay. Small groups of Red-necked Phalaropes were present near convergences throughout the bay.
